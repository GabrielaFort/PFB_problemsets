Kayla by Shel Silverstein

Kayla loves me,
Kayla cares,
Kayla picks me peaches and pears.
Kayla offers me candy and Cokes,
Kayla listens and laughs at me jokes.
Kayla helps when I get in a fight,
Kayla does all my homework at night.
Kayla misses me,
Kayla cries,
Kayla thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Kayla is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Kayla just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Kayla's hand,
In the darkness where Kayla usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Kayla's gone!
